    Absolutely divine. Having this with salted butter and a cup of tea in the morning is nothing short of heaven.+n
    I made no changes to this. Incredibly straightforward and the result is way more than the sum of its parts.+n
    Would make no changes if I made it again. The only thing I may consider is subbing out the egg - I'm assuming it's there for binding.

    Such a simple and straightforward recipe absolutely packed with flavour.+n
    I made the base ahead of time and added the eggs as required. We only ended up using 4 eggs total and splitting the dish over 4 portions, instead of 6 as suggested.+n
    Next time I'd use less stock / less salt - my stock was quite salty and when all was said and done and it was reduced, it was an absolute salt bomb.+n
    Super easy to make, easy to meal-prep, and given that the base is already quite mushy, something that wouldn't do badly in the freezer.
