    Absolutely divine. Having this with salted butter and a cup of tea in the morning is nothing short of heaven.+n
    I made no changes to this. Incredibly straightforward and the result is way more than the sum of its parts.+n
    Would make no changes if I made it again. The only thing I may consider is subbing out the egg - I'm assuming it's there for binding.

    Such a simple and straightforward recipe absolutely packed with flavour.+n
    I made the base ahead of time and added the eggs as required. We only ended up using 4 eggs total and splitting the dish over 4 portions, instead of 6 as suggested.+n
    Next time I'd use less stock / less salt - my stock was quite salty and when all was said and done and it was reduced, it was an absolute salt bomb.+n
    Super easy to make, easy to meal-prep, and given that the base is already quite mushy, something that wouldn't do badly in the freezer.

- text: Another winner. I followed the recipe to the tee, no subs.+n
    Easy to prep ahead, and might be worth making a big batch of caramelised onions that can just sit on the side ready for use whenever. Apart from the onions, the rest of the recipe is minimal cooking.+n
    With onions made ahead of time, this can be on the table in 10 minutes, which is good going.+n
    Easy to meal prep, though I wonder how well eggs would freeze?
