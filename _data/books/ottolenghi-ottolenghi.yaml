      I feel like I went so wrong with these. I measured them out as described, and they didn't spread in the oven. I ended up with 57 coin-sized biscuits.+n
      I used vegan butter in this recipe, as it's all I had. I home-ground the rice (which I need to do finer next time as it still had chunks). I didn't egg-wash the log, I just wet it and rolled and the pistachios seemed to stick.+n
      Next time I'll cut them to 1cm instead of 5mm, make sure the rice is a fine powder and not lumpy. I think the recipe has potential, I think I changed too much all at once.
