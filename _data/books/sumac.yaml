- text: SUBS - Fennel instead of anniseed.+n
    I made these to try and replicate the bread-fingers I used to have as a child in Egypt. Breadsticks that pair delightfully with cheese, but equally hold their own when dipped into tea.+n
    These were close, but on the slightly sweeter side - they were in the dessert section after all.+n
    Easy to make, mix and forget and roll and bake - nothing onerous.+n
    I baked into sticks as opposed to the round medallions suggested - more dipping potential that way.
