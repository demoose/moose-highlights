    This is a DELIGHT. So simple to make. Refreshing yet luxurious. I could spoon and spoon and spoon this into my mouth.
    I used tinned mixed fruit instead of fresh fruit, mainly for laziness, but also for lack of seasonal tropical fruits.+n
    The pudding base could be used as a delightful topping on endless breakfasts / sweets.+n
    I used honey instead of maple syrup - maple syrup is not something I own or use much of.

  Oh lord oh lord oh lord. Firstly, for a recipe that serves 4, I want to know which 4 people Hetty is serving; I've enough soup leftover to feed 4 more people. No complaints however.+n
  I followed this to the tee, minus the rayu (which I'm due to make), instead using Lao Gan Ma - worked relatively well. I added in edamame for more pops of joy.+n
  The bucket of tahini in this replicates that luxurious, palate-coating, lip smacking feel you'd normally get from a meat broth. And the crispy tofu to boot, oh man.+n
  Ridiculously easy to make, in sub 20 minutes, that I can't not make this again. The only thing holding me back is the sheer quantity of tahini in this recipe, which makes it an indulgence.
