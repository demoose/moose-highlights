    This is a DELIGHT. So simple to make. Refreshing yet luxurious. I could spoon and spoon and spoon this into my mouth.
    I used tinned mixed fruit instead of fresh fruit, mainly for laziness, but also for lack of seasonal tropical fruits.+n
    The pudding base could be used as a delightful topping on endless breakfasts / sweets.+n
    I used honey instead of maple syrup - maple syrup is not something I own or use much of.
