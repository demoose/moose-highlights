    This is a DELIGHT. So simple to make. Refreshing yet luxurious. I could spoon and spoon and spoon this into my mouth.
    I used tinned mixed fruit instead of fresh fruit, mainly for laziness, but also for lack of seasonal tropical fruits.+n
    The pudding base could be used as a delightful topping on endless breakfasts / sweets.+n
    I used honey instead of maple syrup - maple syrup is not something I own or use much of.

    Oh lord oh lord oh lord. Firstly, for a recipe that serves 4, I want to know which 4 people Hetty is serving; I've enough soup leftover to feed 4 more people. No complaints however.+n
    I followed this to the tee, minus the rayu (which I'm due to make), instead using Lao Gan Ma - worked relatively well. I added in edamame for more pops of joy.+n
    The bucket of tahini in this replicates that luxurious, palate-coating, lip smacking feel you'd normally get from a meat broth. And the crispy tofu to boot, oh man.+n
    Ridiculously easy to make, in sub 20 minutes, that I can't not make this again. The only thing holding me back is the sheer quantity of tahini in this recipe, which makes it an indulgence.

- text: CHANGES - vegan butter, chia eggs, crunchy PB.+n
    I had no idea what to expect from this but I am supremely happy with the outcome. I veganised this with chia eggs and they turned out really well.+n
    A chewy toothsome centre with a slightly crisp exterior, and the crunch from the peanut butter all merges to make an absolute treat.+n
    Would work well with tahini + sesame seeds, for crunch, I think.+n
    Very quick and easy to make. No faff if you use a microwave to do the mixing of chocolate and butter (I'm not going to setup a double boiler ever.)

    These get an interim 2/5 for mistakes made on my part, no fault of the recipe.+n
    Chia eggs are useless here. I was left with a gloopy mess that doesn't set (and still hasn't close to 24 hours later).+n
    The flavour is good, though the hint of soy is missing - but maybe I just want a stronger taste.+n
    Next time - just use eggs, don't mess around.

    I remade these with egg, still using the vegan butter. Infinitely better.+n
    They are oh-so more-ish and people couldn't stop eating them. The soy sauce flavour doesn't obviously come through.+n
    A Fudgy texture and crisp exterior make it a win. Though not one I'll be making again, but I hate brownies anyway.

    I thought this dessert was an absolute delight. Using tinned mango pulp and mango slices makes this a breeze to put together.+n
    If using the pulp, I wouldn't add the syrup. I didn't bother with the topping either, though I can't imagine it would be bad. Maybe toasted dessicated coconut would work a treat.+n
    Super easy to prep, and fantastic to impress - definitely a make again.

    So I didn't not have success with this. I changed a lot of variables when I probably shouldn't have on my first attempt.+n
    Changes - used the microwave, didn't use the black sesame recipe included and instead used shop-bought black-sesame paste.+n
    I found it exceptionally difficult to work with the mochi after it had been cornfloured, because it wouldn't seal in on itself, and so the mochi unraveled a lot.+n
    As well as this, I felt the recipe made nearly double the quantity of mochi, but that's also likely due to the fact that my mochi ended up on the thinner end.+n
    I will remake this recipe for fun, but so far not my favourite - a lot of difficult faff.

    I took these on my anniversary picnic and they went down a treat. The only disappointment would be the self-restraint required to not eat all 24 rolls.+n
    Absolutely divine. I followed this recipe to a tee (aside from english mustard, instead of dijon), and ended up with the most delicious rolls I've ever had.+n
    There's such an incredible balance of acidity, from the kimchi, sharpness, from the mustard, and sweetness and umami from the mushrooms and leeks.+n
    Incredibly easy to make and there's very little I would change about this. Definitely not a recipe I would make regularly, for health rather than taste reasons.+n
    Riffability - I struggle to think of where this could be altered significantly, as the base recipe is what I would use as a base in other flavour attempts. Though, I suppose anything could be rolled.

    Silky, luxurious mapo tofu with a slight kick of spice. Incredibly easy to make, especially on a weeknight, with little prep involved. I pounded the ginger, garlic and chilli to a paste for ease.+n
    I paired this with a mixture of black and white rice, accompanied by kimchi. We were in heaven. Maybe a boiled egg would go well on the side, to bulk out the protein.+n
    Genuinely very little to comment on when you're elated with how a dish turned out. I will almost certainly be making this again and again.
