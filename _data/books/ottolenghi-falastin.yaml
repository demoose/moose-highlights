    SUBS - Nido instead of normal milk, caramel sugar (caramel that's pulverised into dust), and no egg-wash.+n
    I've made these twice now and in my eyes they are the perfect accompaniment to a hot drink. The sweetness is heavily offset by the richness of the tahini.+n
    I found the dough quite bready and stodgy as apposed to light and fluffy like a cinammon bun, and there was no way I was getting the swirls like in the demo photo.+n
    I'm remaking these with milk-bread as the dough and leaving them un-squished to rise and puff out naturally, and will see how they turn out.
