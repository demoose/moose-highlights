        Handmade and hand-pulled noodles are a delight, though a smidge arduous to make, and require a level of coordination I just don't have. 
        Each noodle boils for 1 minute, and somewhow in the process you're supposed to prep the next noodle - rinse repeat. 
        This recipe could be made into a super easy weeknight dinner by using ramen noodles/spaghetti, ready-made chilli crisp (I used homemade from a previous recipe), and just bung it all together. 
        Whack in some mushrooms and you've got some veg in there too!
