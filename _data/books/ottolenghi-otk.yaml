    Spice mellowed out by the richness of the tahini, and the sweetness of the sichuan peppercorns.+n
    Handmade and hand-pulled noodles are a delight, though a smidge arduous to make, and require a level of coordination I just don't have.
    Each noodle boils for 1 minute, and somewhow in the process you're supposed to prep the next noodle - rinse repeat.+n
    This recipe could be made into a super easy weeknight dinner by using ramen noodles/spaghetti, ready-made chilli crisp (I used homemade from a previous recipe), and just bung it all together.
    Whack in some mushrooms and you've got some veg in there too!

    A spiced, warming porridge contrasting with the crunch of nuts and the tang of the lemon.+n
    With no peanuts available, I just used any nuts I had on hand, sprinkled with salt, and tried not to eat them alone.+n
    This recipe is RAPID - cook to table in sub 20-mins if you're prepared.+n
    My only gripe - dividing this into 4 would yield 4 small-ish portions - double everything and then we're talking.+n
    One to make again and experiment with - I imagine this would make a nice breakfast dish too.
