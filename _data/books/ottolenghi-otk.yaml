    Spice mellowed out by the richness of the tahini, and the sweetness of the sichuan peppercorns.+n
    Handmade and hand-pulled noodles are a delight, though a smidge arduous to make, and require a level of coordination I just don't have.
    Each noodle boils for 1 minute, and somewhow in the process you're supposed to prep the next noodle - rinse repeat.+n
    This recipe could be made into a super easy weeknight dinner by using ramen noodles/spaghetti, ready-made chilli crisp (I used homemade from a previous recipe), and just bung it all together.
    Whack in some mushrooms and you've got some veg in there too!

    A spiced, warming porridge contrasting with the crunch of nuts and the tang of the lemon.+n
    With no peanuts available, I just used any nuts I had on hand, sprinkled with salt, and tried not to eat them alone.+n
    This recipe is RAPID - cook to table in sub 20-mins if you're prepared.+n
    My only gripe - dividing this into 4 would yield 4 small-ish portions - double everything and then we're talking.+n
    One to make again and experiment with - I imagine this would make a nice breakfast dish too.

    A delicate savoury porridge with limitless possibility. Instead of the spring-onions I opted for charred edamame and sweetcorn, bolstering the oats.+n
    The soy butter reduction is to die for, and these oats would be nothing without it (they are at the end of the day just cooked oats). Maybe next time I'd do the reduction with Maggi seasoning sauce.+n
    The substitutes for this are endless. A pre-prepared jar of crispy shallots and fried garlic would make this recipe a 5 minute quick-meal.+n
    I more than likely burnt the garlic and ginger - they need low and slow love and attention, which I didn't provide. Saying that, I don't think they're what make this dish stand out.+n
    At the end of the day, this is a quick congee-esque recipe that can be riffed on to oblivion - it was always bound to succeed.
