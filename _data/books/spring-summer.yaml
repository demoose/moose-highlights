      A brilliant contrast of textures and flavours, that has endless riff-ability.+n
      I used a box of sprouted seeds that I found.+n
      The recipe makes a massive quantity, and could probably be halved so it doesn't get wasted.+n
      The dressing is elegantly simple, though next time I would up the ante somewhat and maybe add some herbs and garlic.
    recipe: Chickpea, pea, sprouted seeds
    rating: 4/5

      This was gobbled up in its entirety. I served this alongside the chickpea salad above, and the contrast in textures and saltiness paired perfectly.+n
      I don't think there's anything I would change about this recipe. It is delightly simple, visually impressive and relatively light. A brilliant weeknight dinner.
    recipe: Freekeh, peaches, feta
