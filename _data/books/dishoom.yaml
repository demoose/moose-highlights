    Modifications - roasted the marinated jackfruit and potatoes, not deep fried. Jasmine rice instead of basmati. Store-bought fried onions instead of fresh.+n
    This came out incredibly well and was lapped up in seconds. Surprisingly easy to assemble, given how much effort I thought went into biryani in general.+n
    Much can be done during the "dead" time as it were, rice can be soaked and cooked whilst the jackfruit marinates and the potatoes boil, then you mix everything and assemble.+n
    Very much a recipe I would make again with the same modifications - I don't have much patience or time to deep-fry for the one recipe.

    Having had this at the restaurant itself I had very high expectations. These expectations were met and beyond.+n
    A surprisingly easy dish, where the only limiting factor is the long slow cook. Aside from that, the rest is a case of patience and throwing in store-brought ingredients.+n
    I made my own garlic and ginger pastes for this daal and the biryani above, though next time will probably use store-brought.+n
    This could be made in vast quantities and prepped / frozen ready for any hankering.
